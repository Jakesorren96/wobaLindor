WOBA is a statistic used in Sabermetrics to determine a players ability to get on base and score runs. Francisco Lindor has a habit of starting of the year before evening out during the second half of the season. By determining Lindor's hitting stats in a 25 game sample split into clusters of five we can predict how his WOBA will be predicted for game 26 and the rest of the year. This is done my determining the following varibles for each game Lindor has played in of the sample. These statistics are needed for the formula of WOBA. Once we have the formula the average of the five game samples are calculated.
